# 🅰️ About the app
Application for learning and studying words / phrases in English.

## 🚀 Features
- creating and managing your own definitions of words / phrases (with dictionaryapi suggestions)
- tests for created definitions
- managing your profile (avatar and username)

# 💡 Motivation
My motivation was to create an app, where I can learn new phrases in English, using my own method, which is :

1. Read the dictionary definition
2. Translate it to your native language
3. Explain it in English
4. Come up with some example for this word / phrase
5. When you have 10 words / phrases, test yourself

And that's exactly how my app works, you learn new phrases following this whole process.
